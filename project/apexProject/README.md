# CS-290 Website Project

This is my project for CS-290. It started out as something grander but I ran into some pitfalls with the API that I planned on using. Some information was unavailable due to the current timing of the project (PvP leaderboards are unavailable between seasons) so I couldn't get the PvP API up and running.

Additionally, the PvE API I couldn't finish in time because of time constraints and obligations to CS 271.

# Grader Helper

To assist graders with finding each required element, use the following list and locations:

    * Download File Button in the intro section (can't miss it).
    * Carousel Slider towards bottom of the page
    
* PvE Page:
    * Unordered List (within Scrollbox).
    * Scroll Box
    
* PvP Page:
    * Unordered List
    
* Server Page:
    * AJAX Query for server statuses
    
* General:
    * Each page is linked to eachother and the home page features the meat of the content.
