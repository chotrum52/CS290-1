/* Your program should output the following to the console.log, including each of the opening and closing
stars. All values in parenthesis should be replaced with appropriate values. To accomplish this, you will
have to sort the array of students using each comparator and then loop through the array and and call logMe
on each student of the now-sorted array. If the argument is 'true' then it prints the student's name, major,
year in school, and club affiliation. If the argument is 'false' then the club affiliation is ommited and
just the student's name, major and year in school is logged. Please carefully note which sorted results require
the club to be displayed and which do not.

**********
The students sorted by year in school are:
(Name - Major - Year) // of the "greatest" student
...
(Name - Major - Year) // of the "least" student

**********
The students sorted by major are:
(Name - Major - Year) // of the "greatest" student
...
(Name - Major - Year) // of the "least" student

**********
The students sorted by club affiliation are:
(Name - Major - Year - Club) // of the "greatest" student
...
(Name - Major - Year - Club) // of the "least" student

**********

As an example of what is expected to be printed to the console with logMe being sent True for a single student:
Jim - Sports Science - 2 - Guitar
